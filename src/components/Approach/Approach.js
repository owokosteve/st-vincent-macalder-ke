                    The primary aim of the organization is to improve the living standard of 
                    the poor people in the Macalder community. The current attention required 
                    from us as an organization to achieve our objective is currently overwhelming. 
                    Despite the economic potential of the region, a lot of people are languishing in 
                    poverty without any governmental/Non-governmental/external agencies intervention, 
                    We are seeking for a more permanent and sustainable means of providing solutions 
                    to the above stated problems, especially establishing an external funding or 
                    partnership as a means to counter the problem.
